# Using Amazon Bedrock with Python

This guide demonstrates how to use Amazon Bedrock to interact with AI models like Claude through AWS SDK.

## Prerequisites

1. An AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock
2. AWS credentials configured on your machine
3. Python 3.7 or later
4. Required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

## Setup

1. Configure your AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Or set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="your_region"
   ```

2. Enable Amazon Bedrock in your AWS account and request model access through the AWS Console.

## Using the Code

1. The example code in `bedrock_example.py` shows how to:
   - Initialize a Bedrock client
   - Make API calls to the model
   - Handle responses

2. You can modify the following parameters:
   - `region_name`: Set to your preferred AWS region
   - `model_id`: Change to use different models (e.g., "anthropic.claude-v2")
   - Request parameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens_to_sample`, etc.

## Example Usage

```python
client = initialize_bedrock_client()
response = invoke_bedrock_model(client, "What is machine learning?")
print(response)
```

## Available Models

Amazon Bedrock provides access to various foundation models including:
- Claude (from Anthropic)
- Titan (from Amazon)
- Jurassic (from AI21 Labs)
- Command (from Cohere)

Select the appropriate model ID when making API calls.

## Error Handling

The code includes basic error handling. Common issues might include:
- Missing AWS credentials
- Insufficient permissions
- Model access not granted
- Invalid parameters

## Best Practices

1. Always handle API responses and errors appropriately
2. Monitor your usage and costs
3. Keep your AWS credentials secure
4. Consider implementing retry logic for API calls
5. Use appropriate model parameters for your use case
